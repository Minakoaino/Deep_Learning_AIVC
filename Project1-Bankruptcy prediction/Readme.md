Bankruptcy prediction project

This is a repository for the first project of Deep Learning course of my master's program.
This file contains the two parts of the assignment and the pdf report file.

The folder contains:
1. The .py and .ipynb files
2. .html file of the project
3. Requirements.txt: the file that contains all the required python libraries to run the project.
